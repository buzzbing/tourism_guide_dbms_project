		<p>This is a website developed to assist us on our project on creating a database management system. We call it "Tourist Management System." It is devoloped by Namrata Das (THA075BEI026), Neelam Karki (THA075BEI027) and Rakshya Panta (THA075BEI029). The present tourism industry in Nepal is in the state of transition in which few organizations and tourists are opting for technological assistance but most of the organizations work individually. Hence, most of the facilities provided by these organizationsâ€™ websites remain concentrated towards the tourist end.
We try to build a website where the data of tourists, tourist sites and organizations (like hotels, transport services, etc.) are collected in database.
<br><br> The database is maintained of the hotel services including the cost per room, cost per meal, number of rooms available, etc. of each hotel and the transport facilities information is also maintained. The tourists are able to choose the sites to visit and also to compare the budget of travel to different places. Tourists can also compare the services and the cost provided by different transport and hotels for similar facilities by simply accessing database.
The convergence of these different organizations also leads to generate a summary for the concerned authorities like Tourism Department of the actual flow of tourists and the expense of travel to a certain place. We aim to build to website for both the tourists and the authorities to have a clear notion of state of present tourism industry and to highlight the areas where development is crucial for overall development of tourism industry.
